# Collaborative Recipe Book

Welcome to our collaborative recipe book project! In this project, we will be curating a collection of our favorite recipes contributed by each team member. To ensure smooth collaboration and version control, we will be utilizing Git and GitHub.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with contributing your recipe:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project under your account.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CalebYeboah27/recipe-book.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your recipe. Name the branch something relevant to your recipe, like `add-pasta-recipe` or `dessert-delights`.

4. **Add Your Recipe:** Write your recipe in a clear and detailed manner. You can use markdown formatting to make it more visually appealing.

5. **Commit and Push:** Add your changes, commit them, and push the changes to your branch on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add my favorite pasta recipe"
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository and open a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a brief description of your recipe and any additional information you want to share.

7. **Collaborate:** Engage with other contributors through discussions on the pull request. You might receive feedback or suggestions for improvements.
