**For the Light Soup:**

- 1 lb (450g) assorted meat and/or fish (goat meat, chicken, tilapia, etc.)
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon ground garlic
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt to taste
- Water
- Fresh vegetables (spinach, cabbage, or other leafy greens)
- Fresh lime or lemon wedges, for serving

## Instructions

**Preparing the Fufu:**

1. In a bowl, combine the cassava flour and plantain flour.

2. Gradually add water while kneading the flours to form a smooth and elastic dough. The consistency should be similar to that of playdough.

3. In a large pot, bring water to a boil.

4. Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into round balls.

5. Place the dough balls into the boiling water and cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the fufu is firm and has a slightly glossy appearance.

6. Remove the fufu from the water and place it in a mortar or fufu pounding machine. Use a pestle or the machine to pound the fufu until it becomes smooth and stretchy.

**Preparing the Light Soup:**

1. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the assorted meat and/or fish and cook until they are tender. Drain and set aside.

2. In the same pot, saut√© the chopped onions until they become translucent.

3. Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook until they soften.

4. Stir in the ground ginger, ground garlic, cayenne pepper, ground coriander, ground cumin, and dried thyme. Cook for a couple of minutes to allow the spices to release their flavors.

5. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients in the pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

6. Add the cooked meat and/or fish back to the pot. Season with salt to taste.

7. Allow the soup to simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

**Serving the Fufu and Light Soup:**

1. To serve, place a portion of fufu on a plate or in a bowl.

2. Ladle the hot light soup over the fufu.

3. Serve with a side of fresh vegetables and lime or lemon wedges.
