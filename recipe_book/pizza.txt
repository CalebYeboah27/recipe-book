**Contributed by:** ChatGPT

## Ingredients

**For the Pizza Dough:**
- 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 3/4 cup warm water (110°F/43°C)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

**For the Pizza Topping:**
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1-2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- Fresh basil leaves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil (for drizzling)

## Instructions

**Preparing the Dough:**

1. In a bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture and olive oil.

3. Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.

4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

**Assembling and Baking:**

1. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 500°F/260°C).

2. Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Roll out the dough into a round circle, about 12 inches in diameter.

3. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone dusted with flour or cornmeal.

4. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border around the edges for the crust.

5. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.

6. Place the thinly sliced garlic evenly over the cheese.

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated oven or pizza stone and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

**Finishing Touches:**

1. Once the pizza is out of the oven, drizzle it with a bit of olive oil.

2. Tear or chiffonade the fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the hot pizza.

3. Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before slicing and serving.

## Notes

- For an extra burst of flavor, you can drizzle a balsamic glaze over the pizza before serving.
- Feel free to add other toppings like sliced tomatoes, olives, or even a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for some heat.

Enjoy the classic Margherita pizza that perfectly balances the flavors of tomatoes, cheese, and fresh basil – a true Italian delight!
