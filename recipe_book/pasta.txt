# Creamy Garlic Parmesan Pasta

**Contributed by:** Caleb Yeboah

## Ingredients

- 8 oz (225g) fettuccine pasta
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

**Cooking the Pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

**Preparing the Creamy Garlic Parmesan Sauce:**

1. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.

2. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Be careful not to let the garlic brown.

3. Pour in the heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for a couple of minutes, allowing the cream to thicken slightly.

4. Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese to the cream, stirring constantly until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.

5. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste. Keep in mind that the Parmesan cheese is salty, so you may not need much additional salt.

**Combining the Pasta and Sauce:**

1. Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the creamy garlic Parmesan sauce.

2. Toss the pasta in the sauce until it's well coated and every strand is infused with the flavorful sauce.

3. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the sauce and finish cooking.

**Serve and Garnish:**

1. Divide the creamy garlic Parmesan pasta among serving plates.

2. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a burst of color and added freshness.

## Notes

- For an extra kick of flavor, you can add red pepper flakes to the sauce while sautéing the garlic.
- Feel free to customize this recipe by adding cooked chicken, shrimp, or your favorite vegetables to the pasta.
