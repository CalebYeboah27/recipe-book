**Contributed by:** Caleb Yeboah

## Ingredients

- 2 cups long-grain parboiled rice
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 3 large tomatoes, blended
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, grated
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 teaspoon ground paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- Salt to taste
- 1 cup cooked and shredded chicken (optional)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish
- Fried plantains, for serving

## Instructions

**Preparing the Jollof Rice Base:**

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat.

2. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent.

3. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.

4. Add the diced red and green bell peppers to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften.

5. Pour in the blended tomatoes and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes reduce and the oil starts to separate from the mixture. This should take about 10-15 minutes.

6. Add the ground cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, coriander, and thyme to the tomato mixture. Stir well to combine and cook for a couple of minutes to allow the spices to release their flavors.

**Cooking the Jollof Rice:**

1. Rinse the parboiled rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and set it aside.

2. Add the rinsed rice to the pot with the tomato and spice mixture. Stir to coat the rice with the flavorful base.

3. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring that the rice is fully submerged in the liquid.

4. Season with salt to taste. Be mindful that the broth already contains some salt, so adjust accordingly.

5. If using cooked chicken, gently fold in the shredded chicken at this point.

6. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and reduce the heat to low. Allow the rice to simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed.

**Serving the Jollof Rice:**

1. Once the rice is cooked, fluff it gently with a fork to separate the grains.

2. Garnish the Jollof rice with freshly chopped cilantro.

3. Serve the delicious Ghanaian Jollof Rice alongside fried plantains for a complete and satisfying meal.
